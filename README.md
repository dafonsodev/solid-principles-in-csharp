# S.O.L.I.D Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to create more maintainable, flexible, and understandable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and provide guidelines for writing clean and effective code. Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design and helps developers create more modular and robust applications. The SOLID acronym stands for:

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. In other words, a class should do one thing and do it well. This helps keep classes focused, reduces coupling, and makes code easier to maintain.

# Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality to existing code without altering its structure. This promotes the use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes to enable future enhancements without breaking existing code.

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
This principle emphasizes that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be able to be used interchangeably with their base class without introducing unexpected behavior. This ensures that inheritance relationships are well-defined and don't violate the expected behavior of the base class.

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that clients (users of an interface) should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. It's better to have smaller, focused interfaces rather than a single large interface. This prevents unnecessary coupling and ensures that clients only need to implement the methods relevant to them.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This promotes decoupling and makes the codebase more flexible and easier to change.

By following these SOLID principles, developers can create software that is easier to maintain, extend, and refactor, resulting in more reliable and adaptable systems over time.
